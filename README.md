# ‚ù§Ô∏è Molecule üôè

### Molecule is a project I created to test my frontend web development skills. Inspired by swiggy.com, this project incorporates various concepts including JSX, React.js, Parcel.js, class-based vs. functional components, props and state management, function mapping, React Hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks), import/export, conditional rendering, API usage, React Router, dynamic routing, and Tailwind CSS.
